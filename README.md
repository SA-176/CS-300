# CS-300

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
    >In this course I was learning data strucures and how to use them and what makes them different. I was learning how to organize inputs and access them with different methods

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
    >To do this I read and studied examples of these kind of data structures to better understand the logic. I wanted to know how the different data structures flowed in the code and what level of complexity they required to accomplish the same tasks. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
    >To make it past the roadblocks I faced I had to reread the supporting material multiple times and I had to find example of the different data structures being used for various purposes. By seeing the examples I was able to piece together how they worked and what processes they needed to take. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
    >It was a great lessson is understanding that not every problem has one solution in coding. That I can always find a new way and if I get stumped I should look out for these methods. It also helped me to futher understand how to process complex data in a program so that I can keep it organized.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    >It helped me to further exand how I break the code appart into classes and functions so that each piece can be used interchangably. This helps to keep the code very adaptable and allows for maintaince through block replacement should a function of the code need to be changed, added, or removed.
